      <h2>What is the CHPL?</h2>
      <p>The Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) is a comprehensive and authoritative listing of all certified Health Information Technology which has been successfully tested and certified in the ONC Health IT Certification program. All products listed on the CHPL have been tested by an Accredited Testing Laboratory (ATL) and certified by an ONC-Authorized Certification Body (ONC-ACB) to meet criteria adopted by the Secretary of the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>
      <p>For more information on attesting for Meaningful Use, please see the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/ehrincentiveprograms/registrationandattestation.html">CMS EHR Incentive Program Registration & Attestation Page</a>.</p>
      <h3>How does the certification process work?</h3>
      <p>The ONC Certification Program was established to ensure that Certified Health Information Technology adheres to the security, functionality, and technology requirements adopted by HHS. Authorized Certification Bodies (ACBs) certify Health IT products that were successfully tested by an Accredited Testing Laboratory (ATL) against the certification criteria adopted by HHS. Products listed on the CHPL have been successfully certified through the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/about-onc-health-it-certification-program">ONC Health IT Certification Program</a> by an ONC-ACB.</p>
      <p>Certification criteria establish the required capabilities, standards, and implementation specifications that health information technology needs to meet in order to become certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program. Certified Health IT Products can be used for participation in CMS and State EHR Incentive Programs.</p>
      <h3>Which Certification Edition do I need to use to attest for Meaningful Use?</h3>

      <h3>What are clinical quality measures (CQMs)?</h3>
      <p>Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs) are used to measure and track the quality of healthcare services delivered by eligible providers, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals.</p>
      <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/ehrincentiveprograms/clinicalqualitymeasures.html">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CQM Basics page</a>.</p>
