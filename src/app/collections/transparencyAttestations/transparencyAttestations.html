      A more transparent health IT marketplace can promote competition, discourage information blocking, and make developers accountable to the needs of health care professionals and other health IT purchasers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under certification rules established by ONC on January 14, 2016, developers must publicly disclose detailed information about their certified health IT products, including limitations and types of costs that a purchaser or user may encounter in the course of implementing or using the developer's technology. Developers must also make a Transparency Attestation indicating whether they will take additional voluntary actions to increase transparency regarding their products and business practices. This includes proactively providing meaningful information to prospective customers and to organizations that publish comparative information and tools for the benefit of health IT purchasers.
